# AI Projects Completed at Codsoft

This repository contains a collection of AI projects that were completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project demonstrates the application of different AI algorithms and techniques.

## Projects

### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe AI
- **Description**: An AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. The AI uses algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to ensure it is unbeatable.
- **Technologies Used**: Python

### 2. Image Captioning
- **Description**: This project combines computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. It uses pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras

### 3. Face Detection and Recognition
- **Description**: Developed an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. The project utilizes pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, with optional face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow
